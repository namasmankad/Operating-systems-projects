Two pass linker, Process and IO schedulers, Memory management unit in Cplusplus

This is a collection of four projects/assignments done as a part of operating systems course at NYU in Fall 2021.

Each scheduling program implements various algorithms which can be chosen by the user through command line arguments. 
The programs use discrete event simulation.

1. Two pass Linker
2. Process scheduler
3. Memory management unit
4. IO scheduler

Refer to the descriptions in the subfolders for full description of the projects.
